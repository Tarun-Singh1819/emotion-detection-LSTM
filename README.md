Emotion detection from text sentences using LSTM model


# Emotion Detection from Sentences using LSTM 

This project detects emotions in user sentences using a deep learning LSTM model.  
It classifies text into emotions like Joy, Anger, Sadness, etc.


## Objective

To develop an emotion classification system using RNNs (LSTM) that takes a sentence and predicts its emotional category.
